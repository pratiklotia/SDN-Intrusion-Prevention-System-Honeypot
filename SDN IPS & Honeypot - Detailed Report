Intrusion Detection, Prevention and Mitigation for Software Defined Networks – using Floodlight Controller.
Author: Pratik Lotia

•	Background:
Since its inception in 2007 at the Stanford University, Software Defined Networks (SDN) is the most promising concept which is
expected to replace a major part of the traditional network engineering. SDN aims at enhancing programmability and automation
of traditional networks. Currently, most of it is done using Network Function Virtualization (NFV) which acts as an overlay
network on the traditional network. SDN provides flexibility to change network configuration for different types of network scaling [1]. The abstraction of application, control and data planes provides easy configurability and reduces total cost of ownership (TCO) by ensuring full potential use of common off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. SDN bridges the gap between network engineers and developers. It is possible for both teams to work together to develop efficient and flexible networks. However, it has been ten long years since SDN was introduced and still it has not yet been implemented on a large scale. The problem is analogous to the problem faced for wide-scale implementation of IPv6 protocol -- Security. The problem is that, SDN is yet to be fully analyzed and understood from the Security point of view. SDN vulnerabilities are yet to be properly identified, let alone patching them and preventing exploits. This project aims at using traditional security monitoring tools to identify attacks on the Data plane and block suspicious traffic with an additional option to analyze the suspicious traffic by redirecting it to a Honeypot.

•	Relevance:
According to Morgan [2], cybercrime is expected to reach $6 Trillion by 2021. On an average [3] it take over 3 months to detect
a breach and network intrusions while remediation takes around 5-6 months. Around $160 million records have been compromised
in 2015 alone. The cloud security market is expected to reach $12 billion by 2022. IoT (Internet of Things), Artificial Intelligence,
Self-driving cars, Machine Learning, Big Data and Fin-techs (Financial technology) will be the prime target for attackers.
All these sectors consist of automation and centrally administered configuration.  These will be using NFV or SDN in some form or
the other. Hence, it is very important to identify threats as soon as possible and also block suspicious traffic before it
compromises private data.
Over the past few years, there have been several attempts to develop a plan to secure SDN architecture at various planes. Some
have intended to develop intrusion detection systems (IDS) while have some have proposed developing firewall system for SDN. A
majority of these have been developed to be compatible with controllers like Ryu & POX while are not widely used anymore. There
have been attempts to develop such systems for commonly used open-source controllers such as Floodlight and OpenDaylight, however,
they have been developed for private usage for their respective companies/projects and not much is available for free public usage.
This system can be used in Data Center networks as well as Service Provider networks. The exact working and compatibility for the
respective environments needs to be analyzed properly before implementing this. This project provides test cases to show the working
of the system. For extensive and full scale usage the user needs to develop signatures for intrusion alerts and according plan to
block each type of packet.

•	Intrusion Detection System:
Intrusion Detection System [4] (IDS) is an application which monitors traffic on a network or a host for any type of suspicious
activity. It generally consists two types – signature-based detection and anomaly based detection. The former uses predefined patterns
of traffic to decide whether an incoming/outgoing packet is suspicious. It can raise alerts which can be sent to the network
administrator or can be logged to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. The latter uses machine learning to detect
a significant change in the traffic behavior.
This project can use either of the types. However, it has been tested using the former type, especially using a common software called
Snort.

•	Intrusion Prevention System:
Intrusion Prevention System [5] (IPS) makes use of IDS to identify the parameters of suspicious traffic and accordingly blocks that
traffic by building Firewall rules or Access Control Lists.

•	Mitigation System:
IDS system raises a lot of false positives. IPS using such IDS can block even good traffic. Also, using IDS and IPS it is impossible
to know the exact intention of the attacker and its purposes to attack the network. To solve this, this project can use a Honeypot
system where our IPS can redirect suspicious traffic to a Honeypot machine instead of directly blocking it. The Honeypot will in
turn determine whether the traffic is really suspicious or it is just a false positive.

•	Working of the project & implied Benefits:
	The project uses an Ubuntu v16.04 64-bit Operating System – VM.
	Floodlight, Mininet and Snort (along with dependencies) are installed and configured on the VM.
	For testing purposes, all rules of Snort except the local user rules have been disabled.
	Snort local rules file is configured with signatures of traffic like ICMP and HTTP.
	Floodlight controller is started and it runs on <localhost_IP> on port 8080.
	Mininet topology is initiated with 1 switch, 5 hosts having IP base of 10.0.0.0/24 with their respective X-terms and Open Virtual
Switch interacting with Floodlight Controller using OpenFlow protocol version 1.3.
	The switch is set as a compatible OVS bridge.
	Port mirroring is enabled on OVS such as traffic generating from and directed to host 4 is mirrored on host 5’s network interface.
	For testing in real world environment, a hybrid router can be used in place of OVS and Router IP Traffic Export (RITE) can be enabled
to mirror traffic.
	Due to mirroring, host 5 actually acts as a network sniffer.
	A security monitoring tool is started on host 5 to analyze all incoming traffic (both mirrored and non-mirrored). For this project,
Snort tool has been used for testing. Alternatively tools for flow analysis like NetFlow & SiLK can be used too.
	For practical purposes, host 5 can be made inaccessible from the public environment so that only mirrored traffic is active on host 5
interface. This way there is no confusion about whether the traffic is for host 5 or for host 4. It will always be for host 4 – just
mirrored on host 5.
	The alerts are directly logged into a text file.
	This Host can now act as an application layer for pushing flow entries to the switch via the Controller.
	A python script reads the alerts file and determines parameters such as source and destination IP, source and destination ports,
protocols and Ethernet type, flags and other header values.
	The python script is configured to dynamically make flows entry matching fields using these parameters. These are written in JSON
format. The flow entry supports all the theoretical variations supported by OpenFlow version 1.3 such as groups, buckets, timers, meter
bands, modify fields, push & pop tags, timers, etc.
	The python script ensures to add a hard timeout value of a few seconds and a higher priority value in the flow entry. It is necessary
to specify the switch DPID (data path identifier) and a unique name for the flow entry.
	Not specifying any action parameter will automatically notify the switch to drop any matching packet.
	This JSON format is properly encoded and sent as a POST message in a proper format using REST API directed to the controller IP and
port which in turn pushes them to the OVS.
	In this way, suspicious traffic can be blocked on the Data Plane. This forms our IPS part.
	IDS can generate several false positives and this can lead to blocking of good traffic. Hence, a hard timeout of a few seconds is
added so that the suspicious traffic is only temporarily blocked. This would considerably slow down attackers while only temporarily
block good traffic.
	Alternatively we can have an additional functionality. Instead of blocking the traffic for a specific match field, it is possible
to modify certain fields of the packet and alter its behavior. We can change the destination IP so that the traffic can be directed to
a different system.
	Using this, we can redirect the traffic to a Honeypot system. The traffic can be analyzed here and we can understand the intent of
the sender of the suspicious traffic. The honeypot system varies from application to application.
	Hence attacks can be mitigated using this method.
	This concludes the working of this project.
